<p>A bowl of cereal is fairly simple to make and it is a great choice to make when in a hurry to go to work or too lazy to cook and is a great choice for breakfast. making cereal can be rough at first but when you know what type of milk you like and how thich you like your bowl to be it is quite easy to get a hang of. In no time you will be able to whip up your own bowl of cereal on your own and be able to master the art of making cereal.</p>
